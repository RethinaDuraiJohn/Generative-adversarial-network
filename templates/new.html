  <h1>Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)</h1><p><br></p>
  <p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful class of neural networks that are used for unsupervised learning. It was developed and introduced by Ian J. Goodfellow in 2014. GANs are basically made up of a system of two competing neural network models which compete with each other and are able to analyze, capture and copy the variations within a dataset.</p><p><br></p>
<p><b>Why were GANs developed in the first place?</b></p><p><br></p>
<p>It has been noticed most of the mainstream neural nets can be easily fooled into misclassifying things by adding only a small amount of noise into the original data. Surprisingly, the model after adding noise has higher confidence in the wrong prediction than when it predicted correctly. The reason for such adversary is that most machine learning models learn from a limited amount of data, which is a huge drawback, as it is prone to overfitting. Also, the mapping between the input and the output is almost linear. Although, it may seem that the boundaries of separation between the various classes are linear, but in reality, they are composed of linearities and even a small change in a point in the feature space might lead to misclassification of data.</p><p><br></p>
<p><b>How does GANs work?</b></p><p><br></p>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be broken down into three parts:<br><ul><li><b>Generative:</b>To learn a generative model, which describes how data is generated in terms of a probabilistic model.</li><li><b>Adversarial:</b>The training of a model is done in an adversarial setting.</li><li><b>Networks:</b>Use deep neural networks as the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for training purpose.</li></ul></p><p><br></p>
<p>In GANs, there is a <b>generator</b> and a <b>discriminator</b>. The Generator generates fake samples of data(be it an image, audio, etc.) and tries to fool the Discriminator. The Discriminator, on the other hand, tries to distinguish between the real and fake samples. The Generator and the Discriminator are both Neural Networks and they both run in competition with each other in the training phase. The steps are repeated several times and in this, the Generator and Discriminator get better and better in their respective jobs after each repetition. The working can be visualized by the diagram given below:</p><p><br></p>
